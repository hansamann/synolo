[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and execution engine to fulfill those queries. It was originally created by Facebook. It's increasingly known among developers and a potential extension / in some cases an alternative to REST-based APIs. You can [read more about GraphQL in a series of blog posts](https://cxlabs.sap.com/tag/graphql/) and see the [latest GraphQL spec here](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/).

[Project Kyma](https://kyma-project.io/) is an open-source project that aims to extend and customize cloud-based and on-premise enterprise applications in a cloud-native, quick and modern way. At this point in time, there is no official way of extending Kyma with features of GraphQL. Therefore, I created this protoype. 

sýnolo is Greek for "total" or "aggregate". This project is called sýnolo, as one of the core features of GraphQL is aggregating different data sources across multiple back-end services. It just relates to one feature of GraphQL, but possibly the most powerful one in the context of enterprise applications.

> PLease note: I do work at SAP CX but this project is a private / spare time contribution. The code part of this repository is a proof of concept implementation. Use at your own risk. The main intent is to increase awareness around GraphQL and it's importance for the enterprise developer community around Kyma.
